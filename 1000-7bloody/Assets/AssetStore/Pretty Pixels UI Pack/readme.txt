==================================

As per Asset Jam 9 rules, these assets are free to own and free to use!

You are welcome to use assets for purposes other than what the files are named- those are just what I had in mind while drawing them.

You are welcome to alter the width of assets to better suit your needs or any other MINOR adjustments (if you need a program to do this with, a good free one I'd recommend is Firealpaca), but please don't upload those adjusted files anywhere.

In fact, don't reupload these assets at all, or otherwise claim them as your own.

If the game you make with these assets is the sort to have credits, I would like to be credited in them.  Refer back to the top of thise file for how to write me down; any combiation of those things is fine.
